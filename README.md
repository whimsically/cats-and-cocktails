# Cats and Cocktails


## URL : 

https://github.com/whimsically/cats-and-cocktails



## Description:

When looking for a cat based on the breed you find interesting, a random cocktail will also display when a cat is chosen. The drinks come completely at random and change anytime a different cat is chosen. For this, we had to use two APIs. One of the API's is a catDB and the other is a cocktailDB API. The HTML was handled by Luis, then the CSS by Nellie, leaving the.JS to Kris and Amanda.
